      <h1 class="topic21">Hikkaduwa turtle hatchery</h1>
      <p>
        <ol class="numSt">
       <li class="ex"> Hikkaduwa is a coastal town located on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, 
        known for its beautiful beaches and vibrant marine life. One of the main
         attractions of Hikkaduwa is its turtle hatcheries, which are popular among 
         tourists and conservationists alike. The hatcheries in Hikkaduwa are part of a
          larger network of turtle conservation efforts throughout Sri Lanka, which aim 
          to protect the five species of sea turtles found in the country.
        </li>
<br>
<li class="ex"> The turtle hatcheries in Hikkaduwa work by collecting turtle eggs that have been
         laid on the beaches and bringing them to the hatchery. Once at the hatchery, the
          eggs are incubated until they hatch, and the hatchlings are kept in tanks for a 
          few days to ensure their safety from predators. Once they are deemed strong enough, 
          the hatchlings are released into the ocean. In addition to protecting the hatchlings,
           the hatcheries in Hikkaduwa also provide medical care to injured turtles and educate 
           visitors about the importance of sea turtle conservation.
        </li>
        <br>
    <li class="ex"> The Hikkaduwa turtle hatcheries have played an important role in the conservation of sea 
        turtles in Sri Lanka. They have helped to increase the number of sea turtle hatchlings that 
        survive to adulthood, which is crucial for maintaining healthy turtle populations. 
        Additionally, the hatcheries have provided employment opportunities for the local 
        community and have become an important source of eco-tourism revenue for the town of Hikkaduwa. 
        While there has been some controversy surrounding the practices of turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka,
         the Hikkaduwa hatcheries have taken steps to ensure that their operations are ethical and sustainable.
          Overall, the Hikkaduwa turtle hatcheries are an important part of Sri Lanka's efforts to protect and 
          conserve its marine biodiversity.
