        <h2 class="topic12"><u>Leatherback sea turtle</u></h2>
        <p>Leatherback sea turtles are the largest living turtles on Earth, reaching up
            to seven feet in length and weighing up to 2,000 pounds. These remarkable 
            creatures have been around for over 100 million years, with their ancestors
            dating back to the time of the dinosaurs. Leatherbacks are known for their
            unique leathery shell, which lacks the bony plates found in other turtle
            species. They are also distinct for their ability to regulate their body
            temperature, which allows them to thrive in both warm and cold waters.Leatherbacks can be found in every ocean on the planet, with some
              on beaches in the tropics.

        <h2 class="topic12"><u>Olive Ridley turtle</u></h2>
        <p>The Olive Ridley turtle is a species of marine turtle known for its olive-colored shell.
             Found in warm oceans, they are relatively small, with adults measuring about 2 feet in 
             length and weighing around 75 to 100 pounds. Olive Ridley turtles exhibit arribada nesting behavior.They are omnivorous, 
             consuming jellyfish, shrimp, crabs, and seagrasses.These turtles face threats such as 
             habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and poaching. Conservation efforts focus on 
             protecting nesting beaches, implementing fishing regulations, and raising awareness.
              Preserving Olive Ridley turtles and their habitats is essential for their survival and the ocean's biodiversity.

        <h2 class="topic12"><u>Loggerhead sea turtle</u></h2>
        <p>The loggerhead sea turtle is a species of marine turtle recognized for its large size and robust appearance. 
            They inhabit various warm and temperate waters around the world, including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.
             Named for their oversized head, loggerheads have a reddish-brown carapace and powerful jaws.
              Adults can reach lengths of about 3 feet and weigh up to 300 pounds or more. 
              Loggerhead sea turtles are known for their strong nesting instincts, often returning to the same 
              beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. They primarily feed on a diet consisting of
               bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crabs, mollusks, and sea urchins.

        <h2 class="topic12"><u>Hawksbill sea turtle</u></h2>
        <p>The hawksbill sea turtle is a remarkable species of marine turtle recognized for its unique appearance and
             ecological significance. Found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, 
             they have a distinctive narrow, pointed beak resembling a hawk's bill, which gives them their name.
              Hawksbill turtles possess a stunningly beautiful carapace characterized by a pattern of overlapping
               scales that resemble tortoiseshell, making them highly sought after for their attractive shells.
                However, this has unfortunately led to their endangerment due to illegal trade. These turtles play
                 a crucial role in coral reef ecosystems, as they feed primarily on sponges, helping to maintain the 
                 health and balance of coral reefs.
