    <i><b>"Of the seven living sea turtle species recorded in the world, five species were reported in the
        coastal belt of Sri Lanka coming for nesting: Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas),Olive Ridley
        (Lepidochelys olivacea), Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and
        Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). The south and southwest coastline of Sri Lanka comprises
        the largest marine turtle rookeries (Amarasooriya, 2000). All five species are still recorded at
        Kosgoda,Induruwa, Rekawa and Bundala. For ex-situ conservation activities and these eggs are reburied within the
        turtle hatcheries for incubation. Law enforcement and the implementation of community-based
        turtle conservation projects at important nesting beaches are not at satisfactory levels in Sri
        Lanka."</b></i>

    <h3 class="topic3">Little bit from history</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In Sri Lanka, there has been a long history of turtle hatcheries. The Sri Lankan government declared five
        species of sea turtles
        to be protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in the early 1970s.</li> <br>
      <li>The widespread hunting of sea turtles for their meat, shells, and eggs prompted this. Nevertheless, despite
        the legal protection, poaching and habitat loss led to a sustained
        drop in turtle populations. To help safeguard and conserve these threatened species, a number of private
        individuals and
        conservation groups erected turtle hatcheries along the nation's southern coast in the late 1970s.</li><br>
      <li>These hatcheries gathered the eggs that were left on the beaches and incubated them until they hatched.
        Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka have developed over time to become significant hubs for sea turtle education and
        protection.</li> <br>
      <li>The country's coastline now has more than 20 turtle hatcheries, with some of the more well-known ones being in
        Kosgoda, Bentota, and Habaraduwa.These hatcheries not only gather and incubate turtle eggs but also treat sick
        and
        injured turtles, inform tourists about the value of sea turtle conservation,
        and carry out biological and behavioral research on turtles.</li> <br>
      <li> Despite significant criticism over the years for specific procedures, turtle hatcheries are still a crucial
        part of Sri Lanka's
        attempts to save its sea turtle species.</li>
